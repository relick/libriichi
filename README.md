1. TODO-MVP: Critical to play a game of riichi mahjong.
2. TODO-AI: Required for functioning AI. AI not usable until all TODO-AI cleared.
3. TODO-QOL: Quality of life feature not necessary for a playable game.
4. TODO-DEBT: Tech debt that it would be nice to find solutions for.
5. TODO-OPT: Optimisation opportunity that it would be nice to improve if possible.
